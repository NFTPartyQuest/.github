# NFT Party Quest

**NFT Party Quest** is an upcoming NFT-collecting game that combines the mechanics of a 3-tool game, a role-playing game, a deck-building game, and a strategy game. Players purchase or craft **NFT**s that are used to generate game tokens. These game tokens are combined together to form a **party**, which is then sent on a **quest** to try to earn rewards.

The game will run in recurring cycles called "seasons." Each season will feature new NFTs, but NFTs from previous seasons will always be playable. Players will have to pay each season to play the game, and are not guaranteed to earn sufficient rewards to repay their entry fees. The cost to play will depend on the number of Card Slots you want to be able to play at one time, so the more you play, the more you pay.

Our primary goal is to keep the basic cost to play the game low to allow many people to play. To accomplish this, the cost to play and the rewards structure will be adjusted for each game season based on the market value of game resources. 

The primary goal of the game is to have fun, but players can expect to earn rewards for completing quests. Rewards may include game tokens, NFTs, WAX, and raffle tickets. Most rewards are only paid for successful completion of quests, and the rewards may not always cover the cost of entering the quest. The gameplay combines player strategy and luck, so some players may earn far more rewards than they pay to play, while others may not earn any rewards. 

As with all blockchain games, play at your own risk and do not invest any more money in the game than you can afford to lose!

## Gameplay

### Overview

The game will be made available to players in seasons covering 3 calendar months each. Each season includes four phases of gameplay available at different times in the season.

|Dates|Activity|
|:--|:--|
|Week 1|Reveal of season details<br/>_No game play available_|
|Weeks 2 and 3|Season crafting event<br/>_Players craft new NFTs (which include 1 card slot each) or buy card slots to play any season's NFTs_|
|Week 4 until final week|Questing Gameplay|
|Final Week|Season Rewards<br/>_Raffles, prizes, and celebration_|

The primary gameplay is only available for about 9 to 9 1/2 weeks out of every season. This is intentional. We want players to play our game at a leisurely pace, and think everyone would benefit from having plenty of time to play with built-in breaks throughout the year.

### Reveal of season details

Every season will start with the reveal of all of the details for the season. Details include revealing new NFTs available to craft, crafting or card slot costs, listing available quests with their requirements and rewards, listing the rewards available at the end of the season, and adjustments to the in-game economy.

This information will be made available online for a full week before the next stage of the season begins. This ensures that all players from all parts of the world and all walks of life have the opportunity to read the season details and plan out their strategy for which NFTs they want to craft or how many card slots they need to buy to match the quest requirements.

### Season crafting event

#### Adventurer Cards

The season reveal begins with 4 new adventurer card NFTs introduced. These are unique NFTs created specifically for this season, and they will only be available to craft during this two-week window. Once the crafting window closes, these character NFTs can **never be crafted again.**

**NOTE:** While the character NFTs cannot be crafted after the season crafting event ends, new NFTs of these characters may be minted as in-game prizes or for promotional purposes.

Each season, one new character NFT will be available for crafting in each of the following classes: 
* Wizard
* Warrior
* Cleric
* Thief

Each character class has specific skills that will make them more or less likely to succeed in certain types of quests. In addition, each new character NFT will have fixed attributes that represent the following traits:
* Intelligence
* Strength
* Vitality
* Charisma

The character's skill in each trait will be represented by a number, 1 through 5. These values will be assigned to the NFT templates. The total value of all traits added together will be 13 for every character. Over time, players can level up their adventurer cards, and will be allowed to increase the value of one attribute for each level gained. These modifications will become permanent once made and can not be changed until the adventure card is leveled up again.

When an adventurer card NFT is staked to the game, it is staked into one of the player's available card slots. Once it is staked, the NFT will generate 1 in-game adventurer token matching the NFTs attributes every 24 hours. These adventurer tokens accumulate throughout the season and can be "claimed" at any time to make them available to send on quests.

#### Equipment Cards

Unlike adventurer cards, equipment cards cannot be crafted. They can only be received as rewards from quests or raffles, or minted by the game developers to use as promotional assets. Like adventurer card NFTs, equipment card NFTs can be staked to the game and will produce equipment tokens of the same type as the staked NFT. Unlike adventurer cards, equipment cards do not utilize a card slot, so you can stake as many equipment cards to the game as you want.

Equipment cards will be minted with a limited number of charges. Once the number of equipment tokens claims reaches the charge limit, the NFT will no longer produce any assets until it is recharged. Players can recharge their NFTs during the question portion of the game by paying a fixed cost (usually in gold) or by burning another equipment card.

Equipment is an optional component that can help balance a team for a quest. Each adventurer token on the team will have two equipment slots that can be left empty or filled with equipment tokens. Equipment is divided into two classes: Armor and Weapons. Each adventurer token sent on a quest can be equipped with zero or one armor token and zero or one weapon token. 

Here are some examples of equipment and their bonuses:

|Name|Class|Intelligence|Strength|Vitality|Charisma|
|---|---|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Staff|Weapon|+1|0|0|0|
|Axe|Weapon|0|+1|0|0|
|Bow|Weapon|0|0|+1|0|
|Sword|Weapon|0|0|0|+1|
|Cloak|Armor|+1|0|0|0|
|Shield|Armor|0|+1|0|0|
|Chainmail|Armor|0|0|+1|0|
|Guard's Uniform|Armor|0|0|0|+1|

Equipment is a very powerful way to adjust your party's attributes to more closely align with the preferred attributes of the quest you embark on.

#### Land Cards

Like equipment cards, land cards cannot be crafted, but can only be won from quest rewards or raffles, or given out as promotional assets. Land cards can be staked to the game to produce food resource tokens. Like equipment cards, land cards will have a limit to the amount of food they can produce before they need to be recharged. 

The amount of food produced each day varies by land type and by season. An example of the production of each type of land is shown below, although the actual amounts may vary in the actual game:

|Land|Winter|Spring|Summer|Fall|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Field|1|2|3|2|
|[Farm](# "=3 fields")|4|7|9|7|
|[Homestead](# "=9 fields")|18|22|27|22|
|[Ranch](# "=27 fields")|68|74|81|74|
|[Estate](# "=81 fields")|243|243|243|243|

The seasonal variability in production decreases for higher-level lands, representing more varied crop types (such as the addition of livestock), food preservation technology, etc.

### Questing

The main focus of **NFT Party Quest** is to send adventurer tokens on quests and reap the rewards.

Each quest will have an ideal skill balance (Intelligence, Strength, Vitality, and Charisma) associated with it. For example, slaying a dragon may favor strength and vitality, while rescuing a kidnapped heir to the throne may favor intelligence and charisma. Players will be able to combine adventurer tokens, equipment tokens, and resources to create parties that are perfectly balanced for a particular the quest.

Quests will vary in type, duration, requirements, etc. There should be a good mix of quests available each season to satisfy whales and newbies alike. For example, you might have 6 different quests available in a season, like those below. Some quests can be completed with a single adventurer, while others require a large, well-equipped team. Quests have specific costs associated with them, so to go on a quest, players will need to have sufficient adventurers, equipment, food, and gold.

Each quest has a variable number of adventurers required. Each season, there should be several quests available that can be played with only a single adventurer, but some quests will require a larger party. The chance of succeessfully completing a quest will **not** depend on the number of adventurers sent on the quest (Otherwise, players with more assets will always have a better chance of winning than players with fewer assets). It is the overall **balance** of attributes in the party as a whole that determines the chance of success.

Each quest will have a fixed cost in food for every adventurer embarking on the quest. Food will be produced by lands staked to the game or purchased with gold from the game at a fixed exchange rate that is determined every season. 

Most quests will also have a fixed cost in gold for each adventurer embarking on the quest. Gold will likely to be harder to come by for smaller players, so there should be at least one quest per season that has no gold requirement that players can go on to earn gold as rewards. Gold can also be acquired from marketplace trades, as a reward for successful quests, as season rewards, or purchased with food from the game at a fixed exchange rate that is determined every season.

### Season Rewards

The final week of every season will be a time for rewards and recognition. Standard quests will reward players with one raffle ticket for every adventurer token sent on that quest, whether they succeed or fail. These raffle tickets can be used during the season rewards portion of the season to enter raffles to try to win prizes.

Ideally, there will be an assortment of mini-games or other activities that players can participate in using raffle tickets to play these games.

## Summary

This game is intended to be infinitely repeatable and customizable to ensure it is enjoyable for as long as possible. The game allows for frequent market adjustments to the in-game economy, which will help keep the market stable for many years to come. The game combines the attributes of a three-tool game, a role-playing game, a base-building game, a collectable card game, and a strategy game into one game. The seasonal schedule of the game allows the development team to continue to provide new game assets through recurring time-sensitive crafting events without having to find new in-game functionality for the new assets that are produced. By requiring players to pay to play each season, we ensure that no matter how many NFTs are generated by the game, they will never flood the market and make other NFTs less valuable. The game should be very easy to play, allow players to play on their own schedule, and be sufficiently rewarding that players come back season after season.


## Game Variants

### NFT Card Quest

In addition to the main NFT game, the developers are working on a physical card game based on the same general concept. This physical card game, called **NFT Card Quest,** will also, at some point, be adapted into another online variant of this game where players can compete with other players online. Every player will be able to open a room where 2-5 players can compete in the card game with one another. Rooms can be open to the public, open by invitation only, or open only to players that meet certain qualifying criteria. The online card game will allow players to play for fun or to set stakes for each game, where every player contributes certain resources at the beginning of the game, and the winner takes the pot at the end of the game. These online game rooms can be played asynchronously, so players do not need to be online at the same time to play. Players will be able to open as many game rooms as they want, although they will have to stake NFTs from their wallet to the game room to provide their hand, so they will only be able to play as many rooms as they can populate with their own NFTs.

### NFT War Quest

A third variant of the game is also under development. This variant, called **NFT War Quest,** will take the same general concept of adventurers forming parties with specific ISVC attributes, but speed up the production time substantially and allow players to build massive armies of tokens that can be sent into real-time combat against other players' armies. This game will be more of a hands-off video game style where players will build their army, then send it out to the battlefield, where each token will autonomously battle with opponents' tokens and destroy one another. Rewards will be paid out periodically on a schedule, so the longer your army survives, the more rewards you will receive.
