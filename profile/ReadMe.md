# NFT Party Quest WhitePaper

**NFT Party Quest** is an NFT-collecting game that combines the mechanics of a 3-tool game, a role-playing game, a deck-building game, and a strategy game. Players purchase or craft NFTs that are used to generate game tokens. These game tokens are used to complete quests and earn rewards. 

The game will run in recurring cycles called "seasons." Each season will feature new NFTs, but NFTs from previous seasons will always be playable. Players will have to pay each season to play the game, and are not guaranteed to earn sufficient rewards to repay their entry fees. The cost to play will depend on the number of Card Slots you want to be able to play at one time, so the more you play, the more you pay.

Our primary goal is to keep the basic cost to play the game low to allow many people to play. To accomplish this, the cost to play and the rewards structure will be adjusted for each game season based on the market value of game resources. 

The primary goal of the game is to have fun, but players can expect to earn rewards for completing quests. Rewards may include game tokens, NFTs, WAX, and raffle tickets. Most rewards are only paid for successful completion of quests, and the rewards may not always cover the cost of entering the quest. The gameplay combines player strategy and luck, so some players may earn far more rewards than they pay to play, while others may not earn any rewards. 

Play at your own risk and do not invest any more money in the game than you can afford to lose!

## Gameplay

### Overview

The game will be made available to players in seasons covering 3 calendar months each. Each season includes four phases of gameplay available at different times in the season.

|Dates|Activity|
|:--|:--|
|Week 1|Reveal of season details<br/>_No game play available_|
|Weeks 2 and 3|Season crafting event<br/>_Players craft new NFTs (which include 1 card slot each) or buy card slots to play any season's NFTs_|
|Week 4 until final week|Questing Gameplay|
|Final Week|Season Rewards<br/>_Raffles, prizes, and celebration_|

The primary gameplay is only available for about 9 to 9$\frac{1}{2}$ weeks out of every season. This is intentional. We want players to play our game at a leisurely pace, and think everyone would benefit from plenty of time to play with built-in breaks throughout the year.

---

### Reveal of season details

Every season will start with the reveal of all of the details for the season. Details include revealing new NFTs available to craft, crafting or card slot costs, listing available quests with their requirements and rewards, listing the rewards available at the end of the season, and adjustments to the in-game economy.

This information will be made available online for a full week before the next stage of the season begins. This ensures that all players from all parts of the world and all walks of life have the opportunity to read the season details and plan out their strategy for which NFTs they want to craft or how many card slots they need to buy to match the quest requirements.

### Season crafting event

#### Adventurer Cards
The season reveal begins with 4 new adventurer card NFTs introduced. These are unique NFTs created specifically for this season, and they will only be available to craft during this two-week window. Once the crafting window closes, these character NFTs can **never be crafted again.**

**NOTE:** While the character NFTs cannot be crafted after the season crafting event ends, new NFTs of these characters may be minted as in-game prizes or for promotional purposes.

Each season, one new character NFT will be available for crafting in each of the following classes: 
* Wizard
* Warrior
* Cleric
* Thief

Each character class has specific skills that will make them more or less likely to succeed in certain types of quests. In addition, each new character NFT will have fixed attributes that represent the following traits:
* Intelligence
* Strength
* Vitality
* Charisma

The character's skill in each trait will be represented by a number, 1 through 5. These values will be assigned to the NFT templates by the development team, and cannot be changed. The total value of all traits added together will be 13 for every character.

When an adventurer NFT is staked to the game, it is staked into one of the player's available card slots. Once it is staked, the NFT will generate 1 in-game adventurer token matching the NFTs attributes every 24 hours. These adventurer tokens accumulate throughout the season and can be "claimed" at any time to make them available to send on quests.

#### Equipment Cards
At the discretion of the development team (depending on the in-game economy), some seasons may allow players to craft equipment card NFTs. Like adventurer card NFTs, equipment card NFTs can be staked to the game and will produce equipment tokens of the same type as the staked NFT. Unlike adventurer cards, equipment cards do not utilize a card slot, so you can stake as many equipment cards to the game as you want.

Equipment is an optional component that can help balance a team for a quest. Each adventurer token on the team will have two equipment slots that can be left empty or filled with equipment tokens. The equipment may include weapons, spells, or armor. Each adventurer token sent on a quest can be equipped with zero or one armor token and zero or one weapon or spell token (If equipping a weapon, you can't also equip a spell, and vice verse). Some equipment can be used by any character class. Other equipment will be limited to certain character classes or certain attributes. 

Here are some examples of equipment and their bonuses:
|Equipment|Class|Intelligence|Strength|Vitality|Charisma|Restriction|
|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|
|Crossbow|Weapon|+1|0|0|0||
|Sword|Weapon|0|+1|0|0||
|Helmet|Armor|0|0|+1|0||
|Army Uniform|Armor|0|0|0|+1||
|Concentration Spell|Spell|+2|-1|0|0|Wizard or Cleric|
|Battle axe|Weapon|0|+2|0|-1|Warrior or Thief|
|Plate Mail|Armor|-1|0|+2|0|Strength4+|
|Friendliness Spell|Spell|0|0|-1|+2|Wizard or Cleric|

Equipment is a very powerful way to adjust your party's attributes to more closely align with the preferred attributes of the quest you embark on.

#### Resource Cards
Some seasons may include the opportunity to craft resource card NFTs. Resource card NFTs can be staked to the game to produce resources that are necessary for the game play.

Initially, the only resource available will be food, and it will be produced by **field** resource cards. There may be additional resources introduced to the game in later iterations, or additional resource cards that produce different amounts of food (For example, if a field produces 3 food per day, a farm might produce 9 food per day).

Gold will not be produced as a resource. It can be purchased in-game for a fixed rate or acquired as a prize for completing a quest. Gold cannot be purchased directly, but must be paid for with food, which can be aquired from field resource cards. Additionally, players will be able to trade adventurer tokens and equipment tokens for gold in the marketplace. The decision not to make gold available in-game is an intentional decision made to avoid having the developers set the market rates for resources. This may change in the future if there becomes a need for additional sources of gold.

Initially, gold and food will be only in-game assets, but at some point the devs may consider making them available on a secordary market like alcor.

More details of the crafting event are provided [below](#user-content-season-crafting-event-details).

### Questing

The main focus of **NFT Party Quest** is to send adventurer tokens on quests and reap the rewards.

Each quest will have an ideal skill balance associated with it. For example, slaying a dragon may favor strength and vitality, while rescuing a kidnapped heir to the throne may favor intelligence and charisma. Players will be able to combine adventurer tokens, equipment tokens, and resources to create parties that are perfectly balanced for a particular the quest.

 Quests will vary in type, duration, requirements, etc. There should be a good mix of quests available each season to satisfy whales and newbies alike. For example, you might have 6 different quests available in a season, like those below. Some quests can be completed with a single adventurer, while others require a large, well-equipped team. Quests have specific costs associated with them, so to go on a quest, players will need to have sufficient adventurers, equipment, food, and gold.

Each quest has a variable number of adventurers required. Each season, there should be several quests available that can be played with only a single adventurer, but some quests will require a larger party. The chance of succeessfully completing a quest will **not** depend on the number of adventurers sent on the quest (Otherwise, players with more assets will always have a better chance of winning than players with fewer assets). It is the overall balance of attributes in the party as a whole that determines the chance of success.

Each quest will have a fixed cost in food for every adventurer embarking on the quest. Food will be produced by lands staked to the game or purchased with gold from the game at a fixed exchange rate. 

Each quest will have a fixed cost in gold for each adventurer embarking on the quest. Gold will likely to be harder to come by for smaller players, so there should be at least one quest per season that pays a fixed amount of gold regardless of success or failure for each adventurer instead of costing gold. These quests should have a low chance of success, which is compensated for by paying a fixed amount of gold when the quest begins. Gold can also be acquired from marketplace trades, as a reward for successful quests, as season rewards, or purchased with food from the game at a fixed exchange rate. 

More information about questing is provided [below](#user-content-questing-details).

## Detailed Descriptions of each Phase of Gameplay

### Season Reveal Details

At the beginning of the season, before gameplay commences, the devs will post a detailed overview of the upcoming season. There will be a lot of details to cover each season, so this information can get pretty lengthy, which is why players are given a full week to read and digest the details.

The 4 new adventurer card NFTs will be revealed for the first time during the season reveal. This will include the card design, each character's attributes, any back-story about the characters, and the cost to craft each character.Initially, the cost will be the same to craft any character, but the devs can adjust these costs as needed to help balance the game (If there are too many wizards, the devs might make it cheaper to craft thieves for the current season, etc.).

The season reveal will also outline the cost to purchase a card slot. This should be the same as the cost to craft an adventurer card NFT, or at least very close to it. Again, the devs can adjust this season-to-season to help balance the game. If too many people are crafting new cards and not utilizing older cards, it might be cheaper to buy a card slot instead of crafting a new NFT.

Crafting costs can include a combination of WAX and any game NFTs. The crafting costs should be balaced each season, so one season's crafting event might cost 30 Wax, and if the market changes before the next season, the cost might adjust to 3 Wax 6 Equipment, and 1 Field. This is a great opportunity for the devs to periodically balance the in-game economy by setting the cost for each season independently.

The devs can choose to have multiple ways to cover crafting costs, if desired. For example, the cost might be `20 WAX` or `10 Wax and 1 Adventurer NFT` or `12 WAX and 3 Equipment NFTs`. This is a great opportunity to burn excess assets to help re-balance the economy periodically.

Depending on the need, the game devs might make other NFTs craftable during the season crafting event. Other NFTs might include new (or old) equipment card NFTs or resource card NFTs. The price for these NFTs can be set at any price deemed suitable to the devs, and does not have to reflect the price for crafting adventurer card NFTs or buying card slots.

A detailed description of each quest available in the season will be made available to players during this week. Because each quest has a specific balance of preferred attributes, players will use this announcement to look through the new adventurer card NFTs revealed for the season and any other adventurer card NFTs they own to decide how many new NFTs they wish to craft and how many card slots they wish to purchase.

Exchange rates for the in-game marketplace will also be publishid during the season reveal. See the **marketplace** section below for more information.

Finally, the details of the season-ending raffles and the contents of the players' rewards chests will be revealed so players will be excited about what they might win at the end of the season.

### Season Crafting Event Details

The season-opening crafting event will be open for the second and third weeks of the season. The price of crafting assets will not change during the two-week crafting event to ensure all players have ample opportunity to participate. During this phase (and only during this phase), players can choose to **craft new NFTs** or **buy card slots** to use with their existing adventurer card NFTs, or any combination of these options.

Players will be able to craft any of the four new adventurer card NFTs each season, and may have opportunities to craft equipment card NFTS or resource NFTs as well. Cards released in previous seasons cannot be crafted in future seasons. Each adventurer card NFT crafted will include one card slot that can be used during the questing season.

Players can also choose to buy card slots without crafting new adventurer card NFTs. Players will only be able to stake as many adventurer cards as they have card slots available. This will limit how many adventurer card tokens will be generated to be sent on quests.

Allowing players to stake previous season's adventurer card NFTs will give players a lot of flexibility in creating their "decks" that they can use during the season. This gives players the ability to create the best party they can to match the requierements for specific quests.

Most NFT gamers don't want to craft unique NFTs if they can never use them again, but many NFT-based games eventually become unstable because new assets are continuously created and the market gets flooded. In _NFT Party Quest,_ however, there will never be an excess of character NFTs, because players can only play as many cards as they can afford each season.

During the crafting event, when a new adventurer card NFT is crafted, it will be pre-staked to the game so that it will start producing adventurer card tokens immediately as soon as the season begins. If the card is unstaked after being minted but before the season begins, it cannot be re-staked until the questing portion of the season opens.

Similarly, when a player purchases a card slot, they will have an opportunity to pre-stake an existing card from their wallet in the new card slot so that it will start producing adventurer card tokens immediately as soon as the season begins. If the NFT staked to the card slot is unstaked before the season begins or the player chooses not to stake an NFT at the time the card slot is purchased, it cannot be re-staked until the questing portion of the season opens.

Adventurer card NFTs that are pre-staked to the game during the crfating event will each produce one adventurer card token as soon as the season begins, so players will be able to start sending their tokens on quests immediately as soon as the season opens.

Equipment card NFTs and resource card NFTs, as well as adventurer card NFTs that are not pre-staked, can be staked to the game at any time during the questing portion of the season as long as the player has enough available card slots. When these NFTs are staked to the game, they begin producing tokens (typically one every 24 hours).


### Questing Details

#### Staking/Unstaking NFTs
In order to produce resources, equipment, and adventurer tokens, players need to **stake** NFTs to the game. As soon as the NFT is staked to the game, it starts producing tokens. Most NFTs will produce one token (a disposable resource that can only be used in-game) every 24 hours. That means that players will have to wait at least 24 hours after staking their NFTs to claim the tokens they produce.

If an NFT is removed from the game (**unstaked**), any unclaimed tokens are added to the player's in-game wallet, but any partially-produced tokens are forfeited. This system allows players to swap out NFTs throughout the season, but makes it slightly disadventageous because at least some time will be lost as the assets are unstaked and staked to the game.

Any number of equipment and resource card NFTs can be staked to the game during the questing portion of the season. Adventurer cards, however, are limited to the number of card slots the player has purchased for the season. If a player owns 23 adventurer card NFTs, but only buys 10 card slots during the crafting event at the beginning of the season, they are only able to have 10 adventurer cards staked to the game at any time during the questing portion of the season.

There is no way to purchase additional card slots after the crafting event has closed, so players are cautioned to think through how many card slots they want to purchase at the beginning of the season. But that doesn't mean that a player who missed the crafting event is completely out of luck. Food produced by resource card NFTs and equipment produced by equipment card NFTs can both be sold in the marketplace for gold, which can then be used to buy adventurer card tokens in the marketplace (Described below).

#### Claiming tokens
Each adventurer card, equipment card, or resource card NFT staked to the game during the questing portion of the season will produce in-game tokens on a fixed schedule. Typically, this will be 1 token every 24 hours, but may change for specific NFTs. For example, fields may produce 5 food tokens every 24 hours. These tokens accumulate as long as the NFT is staked to the game. The tokens accumulate until they are claimed by the player, at which point the available tokens are added to the player's in-game wallet. There is no limit to the number of tokens that can accumulate before being claimed, and claming available tokens will not change the production schedule. 

For example, if a field NFT produces 5 food every 24 hours and you come back 12 hours later, you will not have any tokens available to claim. If you wait until 24 hours after you staked the field NFT to the game, you will be able to claim 5 food tokens.

If you then wait three and a half days before you come back to the game, you will have 15 food (5 food a day for 3 days) ready to claim, and 12 hours remaining until the next 5 food become available. When you claim the 15 food tokens, you will still have 12 hours remaining until the next 5 food become available.

There is no penalty for waiting to claim your tokens. This makes the game very flexible, and allows players with busy schedules to play at their own convenience, without having to worry about checking on the game every couple of minutes or couple of hours like so many NFT games. However, as the questing season nears its end, some quests will no longer be available (Players cannot start a quest unless it can be completed before the questing portion of the season ends). So players will want to send as many of their adventurer card tokens on adventures as possible before the season ends.

#### Questing

As adventurer card, equipment card, and resource card tokens are produced, they can be joined together into parties and sent on quests. All tokens sent on a quest will be burned and will no longer be available to the player regardless of whether the quest succeeds or fails.

Quests will have specific requirements that must be met by the party before beginning the quest. Typically, these requirements include a specific number (or range) of adventurer tokens, food tokens, and gold tokens. The quest cannot be started unless the party matches all of the quest requierements.

Each quest will have preferred attributes that will be used to determine the party's chance of successfully completing the quest. These preferred attributes will be expressed as a percentage of each of the 4 attributes (Intelligence, Strength, Vitality, and Charisma). This percentage is based on the total of each of the attributes across all party members.

Every quest that is undertaken will reward the player with at least one raffle ticket for each adventurer token in the party. These raffle tickets can be exchanged for prizes at the end of the season or can be used to enter raffles for prizes at the end of the season.

Every quest will have certain rewards that can be won if the quest is successful. Quests will typically have some guaranteed rewards (Such as food or money), but may also offer some rewards that are up to chance and not guaranteed. Players can win adventurer tokens or equipment tokens that can be any existing adventurer or equipment that has been produced in the game previously. Players may also have a small chance of receiving NFTs of either adventurer cards, equipment cards, or resource cards. 

On average, the rewards for quests should be slightly more than the cost to play so players can be rewarded for the time spent on the game. However, there is no guarantee that players will receive rewards that will cover the cost of the assets sent on the quest.

---

These are just examples, of course, but give you an idea of what to expect. The chance of succeeding in each mission is determined by how closely the party's skills match the requirements minus a certain percentage for more difficlut quests. Reward payout chances and quantities will be appropriate for the cost and time involved in the quest, balanced each season to adjust for the current in-game market.

##### Quest Skill Matching
Your chance of succeeding on a given quest depends on how closely you can match the preferred skills for that quest.

Your party will consist of one or more adventurer. Regardless of the number of adventurers sent on the quest, it is the _balance_ of skill that is important. Your party's total skills in each attribute should match the preferred percentage listed on the quest itself.

**Example:**
A party consisting of one adventurer with an intelligence of 2, strength of 5, vitality of 3, and charisma of 3 would have a total skill value of 13 (2+5+3+3=13). 

Converting this to rounded percentages, the party would have 15% intelligence, 38% strength, 23% vitality, and 23% charisma (I understand that comes out to 99% because of the rounding, but that just adds to the challenge).

If the quest's requirements are 15% intelligence, 40% strength, 20% vitality, and 25% charisma, your party's **intelligence** matches the quest's preferences by 100%, **strength** matches by 95%, **vitality** matches by 87%, and **stamina** matches by 92%. When comparing your party's percentage for an attribute with the preferred percentage, you divide the smaller number by the larger number. This way, it does not matter whether you are over the preferred percentage or under it. In this example, our strength percentage is less than the preferred percentage for strength, so we divide 38 by 40 to get 92%. But our vitality percentage is more than the preferred percentage for vitality, so we divide 20 by 23 to get 87%. You will never get more than a 100% match.

Once we know our party's relative attributes (the percentages calculated above), we multiply the matching percentage for each attribute together to get the chance of a successful mission: 100% * 95% * 87% * 92% =  76%. 

Your party's chance of successfully completing the quest is **76%**.

Some quests are particularly difficult, and will have a _Challenge Penalty_ assigned to them. This challenge penalty will be subtracted from the chance of success calculated above. If we are embarking on a quest with a -15% Challenge Penalty, our final chance of successfully completing the quest will be **61%** (76% - 15%).

The same calculation would apply if there were more than one adventurer in the party...simply add together the values of each skill and divide by the total values for all skills of all party members and calculate the percentages. 

The success rate for all quests will be capped at 90%, so even if you match the preferred skills by 100%, you will only have a 90% chance of successfully completing the mission.

#### Player marketplace

During the questing portion of the season, players will be able to access the player marketplace where they will be able to exchange their resources for other resources.

**Food and Gold**
Food and gold con always be exchanged for one another in the marketplace. Each season, the food/gold exchange rate will be published during the season reveal, and will not change during the season.

If the exchange rate is 5 food for 1 gold, players can sell their food, in increments of 5, and receive gold in return. Similarly, players can sell gold to receive five food for each gold sold. These exchanges are always available, as long as the player has enough tokens to sell, and the exchange will be instantaneous.

**Equipment and Adventurer Tokens**
Equipment and adventurer tokens can be exchanged in-game with other players. Each season, the exchange rate for each asset type will be published during the season reveal, and will not change during the season. Players will **not** have the ability to sell their in-game tokens for any other price except the designated exchange rate.

If the exchange rate is 1 gold for 1 adventurer token and 1 gold for 1 equipment token, players can either sell their equipment and adventurer tokens to receive gold in return, or can sell their gold to receive equipment or adventurer tokens in return.

Unlike the food/gold exchange, this market is entirely driven by players. When you request to sell an adventurer or equipment token, the token will be removed from your wallet immediately and listed for sale in the marketplace. But you will not receive any gold unless someone purchases that adventurer token from the marketplace. When you request to buy an adventurer or equipment token, the cost in gold will be deducted from your wallet and your request to buy the designated token will be listed in the marketplace.

Marketplace listings are fulfilled by an automated in-game process, and are not processed instantly. The listings are fulfilled periodically by a process that looks at each item listed for sale and tries to find a matching request to buy that item. If a match is found, one set of assets is exchanged. If there are additional items listed for sale, the process will then try to fulfill the next item from a different buyer.

This is a deliberately complex system that is used to ensure that players with many assets for sale do not dominate the marketplace. If each sale were fulfilled based on the date that the sale was listed, players with more assets would dominate the marketplace and there would be no opportunity for players with a smaller number of assets to participate.

To make sense of this, let's look at an example:

**Player 1** lists a request to sell 7 helmets for 1 gold each.
**Player 2** lists a request to sell 350 helmets for 1 gold each.
**Player 3** lists a request to sell 1 helmet for 1 gold.

**Player 4** lists a request to buy 1 helmet for 1 gold.
**Player 5** lists a request to buy 2 helmets for 1 gold each.
**Player 6** lists a request to buy 3 helmets for 1 gold each.

This would give us the following marketplace listings:
|Player|Total Helmets|Total Gold|
|---|---|---|
|Player 1|7|0|
|Player 2|350|0|
|Player 3|1|0|
|Player 4|0|1|
|Player 5|0|2|
|Player 6|0|3|

These requests would be fulfilled by an automated process that would look through all of the assets listed for sale in the marketplace. When it gets to the helmet asset, it begins fulfilling the order as follows:

**First iteration**
|Player|Changes to Helmets|Changes to Gold|Total Helmets|Total Gold|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Player 1|-1|+1|6|1|
|Player 2|0|0|350|0|
|Player 3|0|0|3|0|

In this example, all three players who wanted to purchase helmets were able to buy the helmets they wanted. And all three players who wanted to sell helmets were able to sell some of their helmets to meet the demand. But the player selling 350 helmets was not able to block sellers selling 7 and 3 helmets. In this way, everyone gets a chance to buy and sell until the demand was filled. This system is not really fair, because the first player to list their products for sale should expect to sell them before latecomers sell their products. But for a game environment, this system ensures that everyone gets a fair chance to experience the full gameplay, whether they are a major playor or only a casual player.

**Claiming assets from a listing**
When the listing is fulfilled, the assets are not directly deposited into the players wallets. Instead, the fulfillment is stored in the listing until the user claims any pending payments. This is done because the user needs to sign a transaction on the blockchain when they add resources to their wallet, so the game cannot deposit the assets until the player signs the transaction.

When the listing was created, the asset being sold was removed from the player's wallet. When a fully or partially fulfilled listing is claimed, any payment assets that have not already been claimed will be deposited into the player's wallet. If the listing has not been completely fulfilled, any remaining assets will remain available on the marketplace until they are fulfilled.

**Cancelling a listing**
At any time, players can cancel any active listings. When they cancel a listing, any unclaimed payment assets from the portion of their listing that has been fulfilled will be deposited into the player's wallet. Any assets that were initially listed for sale that have not yet been fulfilled will be returned to the player's wallet. The listing will then be removed from the marketplace.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
The in-game marketplace is provided as a for players' convenience and entertainment. It is not a financial tool, and no listings are guaranteed. Marketplace listings will only be fulfilled if there is sufficient demand for the asset listed. The developers will do everything they can to ensure that the marketplace operates efficiencly and accuratel. However, NFT Party Games does not guarantee any listings in the marketplace, and any assets lots due to bugs or glitches in the marketplace fulfillment software can not be recovered. Players are advised to use the marketplace at their own risk.

### Banquets and Prizes

Every quest completed, success or failure, will reward the player with one raffle ticket per adventurer in the quest's party. These raffle tickets are in-game tokens that are not tradeable outside of the game.

However, the raffle tickets can be used to claim prizes at the end of the season. There are two ways players can use their raffle tickets: **Season Rewards Chests** and **Raffles.**

Each player will have access to an identical rewards chest that belongs exclusively to them. The rewards chest will contain a variety of rewards, and players can exchange one raffle ticket for one draw from their rewards chest until their chest is empty.

The rewards chest will have a fixed number of prizes available to each player, and each time a raffle ticket is exchanged for a prize, the player will receive one item from the rewards chest at random until the chest is empty. Once the rewards chest is empty, it will not be refilled.

Initially, the rewards chests will have 200 prizes available, though this number may be modified in future seasons by the developers. The rewards chest contents will be revealed at the beginning of each season during the season reveal event.

Most of the rewards in the chest will be in-game tokens that the player can use in future seasons to send parties on quests. There may also be NFT prizes that can be claimed, which will mint a new NFT of the specified type and deliver it to the player's blockchain wallet.

Here's an example what might be contained in a player's rewards chest:
|Prize|Remaining Quantity|
|---|---|
|1x (Random) Adventurer or Equipment Card NFT|1|
|1x Field Resource Card NFT|1|
|500x Gold Resource Token|1|
|150x Food Resource Token|3|
|100x Gold Resource Token|3|
|150x Gold Resource Token|3|
|300x Food Resource Token|3|
|10x Arayus Token|5|
|10x Ryker Token|5|
|10x Sylanna Token|5|
|10x Grod Token|5|
|5x (Random) Adventurer Token|5|
|20x (Random) Adventurer Token|5|
|5x Helmet Equipment Token|10|
|5x Army Uniform Equipment Token|10|
|5x Crossbow Equipment Token|10|
|5x Sword Equipment Token|10|
|20x (Random) Equipment Token|10|
|1x Arayus Adventurer Token|15|
|1x Ryker Adventurer Token|15|
|1x Sylanna Adventurer Token|15|
|1x Grod Adventurer Token|15|
|1x (Random) Adventurer Token|15|
|10x Food Resource Token|15|
|5x Gold Resource Token|15|
|**TOTAL**|200|

This means that any player who receives 200 raffle tickets will be able to receive every single reward in this chest. Remember that every adventurer token sent on a quest is guaranteed to receive at least one raffle ticket (whether the quest succeeds or fails), and may receive more than that, depending on the quest and whether the quest was successful or not.

The season rewards chest will be available during the banquets and rewards portion of the season (The last two weeks). Players can redeem raffle tickets for rewards from their chest at any time during this phase of the season. Every player has their own chest, and every chest starts out with the same contents as every other player's chest.

**Raffles**

In addition to the player's rewards chest, players will be able to exchange raffle tickets for entries into various raffles held during the banquets and rewards portion of the season. Players who earn fewer than 200 raffle tickets during the season will have to decide whether they want to spend their raffle tickets on rewards from their rewards chest or use them to buy entries into the season's raffles.

There will be many raffles available at the end of each season, and the raffles will be announced at the beginnig of the season during the season reveal, so players will be able to plan ahead and decide which raffles they want to enter. Some raffles will be open for the entire banquet and rewards portion of the season, but most raffles can only be entered during certain windows during the banquets and rewards portion of the season. Raffles should always be open for at least 24 hours to accommodate players' schedules as much as possible.

Players can exchange one raffle ticket for one entry into a raffle of their choice. Entering a raffle buys the player one chance to win out of however many entries there are at the time the raffle closes. The more people who enter a raffle, the lower the chance each entry has to win the prize being raffled off.

The developers should plan enough raffles to ensure that players have a reasonable chance of winning. It's not much fun to spend 10 raffle tickets to get 10 entries into a raffle, and then find out that there were 250,000 entries, and your chance of winning is only 0.004%. 

Each raffle will have its own prize, which can range from a specific number of in-game tokens (adventurer, equipment, or resource) to NFTs to WAX rewards.

Since there is no guarantee that a player will win a raffle, we encourage players to redeem their raffle tickets for prizes from their season rewards chests first, and only enter raffles if they have leftover raffle tickets after redeeming all of the prizes (or all they want) from their season rewards chest. But the raffles are there to give players a chance to use their excess raffle tickets for at least a chance to win a prize.

The last week should have a celebratory element to it, so the game devs might host livestreams where raffles are drawn and prizes are rewarded in real-time, or they might host other events and charge people a fixed number of raffle tickets to attend. There are many possibilities, but the point is to make the last two weeks of the season as much fun as possible, and get players excited about how well they did so they want to play again the next season.

Ideally, players will feel that the cost of entry was well-spent and that they received enough rewards to cover the cost of entry or that they had enough fun during the season that the money they paid was well spent. While we don't promise that players will earn enough rewards to cover the cost of playing, we do hope that the cost is low enough and the enjoyment is high enough that players want to keep coming back season after season.

At some point during the banquets and rewards portion of the season, any assets that are still staked to the game should be automatically unstaked from the game and returned to the player's blockchain wallet. Players can manually unstake their assets at any time, but if they forget, the assets should be returned to them automatically at the end of every season.



## Summary

This game is intended to be infinitely repeatable and customizable to ensure it is enjoyable for as long as possible. The game allows for frequent market adjustments to the in-game economy, which will help keep the market stable for many years to come. The game combines the attributes of a three-tool game, an RPG, a base-building game, and a strategy game into one game. The seasonal schedule of the game allows the development team to continue to provide new game assets through recurring time-sensitive crafting events without having to find new in-game functionality for the new assets that are produced. By requiring players to pay to play each season, we ensure that no matter how many NFTs are generated by the game, they will never flood the market and make other NFTs less valuable. The game should be very easy to play, allow players to play on their own schedule, and be sufficiently rewarding that players come back season after season.

In addition to the main NFT game, the developers are working on a physical card game based on the same general concept. This physical card game will also, at some point, be adapted into another online variant of this game where players can compete with other players online. Every player will be able to open a room where 2-5 players can compete in the card game with one another. Rooms can be open to the public, open by invitation only, or open only to players that meet certain qualifying criteria. The online card game will allow players to play for fun or to set stakes for each game, where every player contributes certain resources at the beginning of the game, and the winner takes the pot at the end of the game. These online game rooms can be played asynchronously, so players do not need to be online at the same time to play. Players will be able to open as many game rooms as they want, although they will have to stake NFTs from their wallet to the game room to provide their hand, so they will only be able to play as many rooms as they can populate with their own NFTs.
